# NYC-Taxi-Trip-Prediction

At some point or the other almost each one of us has used an Ola or Uber for taking a ride. 

Ride hailing services are services that use online-enabled platforms to connect between passengers and local drivers using their personal vehicles. In most cases they are a comfortable method for door-to-door transport. Usually they are cheaper than using licensed taxicabs. Examples of ride hailing services include Uber and Lyft.

To improve the efficiency of taxi dispatching systems for such services, <b>it is important to be able to predict how long a driver will have his taxi occupied</b>. If a dispatcher knew approximately when a taxi driver would be ending their current ride, they would be better able to identify which driver to assign to each pickup request.

Our goal in this prject is <b>to build a model that predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City</b>.
